# FF1-Randomizer-tracker

A basic tracker for the Final Fantasy 1 Randomizer for items and key locations.

Items tracked currently include each orb, every key item for progression or npc flags, and the masmune.

Locations tracked include any npc that gives an item, dungeon locations that hold key items in vanilla, and the locked Coneria chests.

A variant for the Treasure Hunt flag is included that progressively ticks up the shard count up to 30.

New features may be added in the future depending on suggestion and what I can figure out how to do in json/lua.

Thank you to EmoSaru, for making Emotracker, Splitpunched, whose browser-based FF1 tracker was the basis for knowing what items/locations needed included, and doicm, whose scripts for their FF5 Career Day tracker was what I looked off of to sort of figure out how to make an emotracker package.
